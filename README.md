# Authorization Service

## Overview

The **Authorization Service** is a secure and scalable backend service for handling user authentication and authorization. Built using Java, Spring Boot, and Gradle, it offers robust mechanisms for managing user roles, access control, and session security using JWT tokens.

## Features

- ✅ **User Authentication** – Handles secure user registration and login.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Assign roles and restrict endpoints accordingly.
- 🔑 **JWT Token Support** – Stateless session management with JSON Web Tokens.
- ⚙️ **Extensible Architecture** – Designed to be easily integrated into broader microservices or monoliths.
- 🚀 **Built with Modern Java Practices** – Clean code, layered architecture, and RESTful API design.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Gradle

## Learnings

This project served as a valuable learning experience in building secure backend services using modern Java technologies. Key takeaways include:

-  🧠 Understanding JWT: Learned how to implement and validate JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication.

-  🧱 Spring Security Fundamentals: Gained hands-on experience with filters, authentication providers, and secure route handling in Spring Boot.

-  🔄 Separation of Concerns: Applied layered architecture principles (Controller → Service → Repository) for maintainability and scalability.

-  🔍 Exception Handling: Implemented global exception handling for cleaner and more user-friendly error responses.

-  ⚒️ Custom Authentication Flow: Built a custom login and registration system using Spring Security.
  
-  🌐 RESTful API Design: Improved REST API design practices, including proper use of status codes and endpoint naming.
